    <h2>Lina's Story</h2>
    <p>My name was Lina. I was only 20 years old when an absurd accident took my life while I was rafting on the Wolf River.</p><p>I loved life and nature, and I had a special passion for children. I wanted to become a third grade teacher, so after <br>I graduated from Middleton High School, I enrolled at <br>UW-Oshkosh and was about to start my junior year. Once <br>I graduated, my goal was to teach kids and encourage them to build a better world. After my sudden departure, my beloved family decided to take three actions:</p>
</div>
  <div class="sections linas_law">
  	<span>
    <span class="number">1</span><h3>Lina's Law has Passed</h3><img class="butterfly" src="img/butterfly.png" alt="Butterfly" height="20" width="22" /></span>
    <p>The petition our family began after the tragic passing of Lina drew the attention of legislatures, media groups, sectors of Wisconsin’s tourism industry and the public in general. On June 20th, 2014&mdash;close to two years after the tragedy&mdash;Lina’s family announces that Lina’s Law has become a reality. Thanks to the tremendous support from Wisconsin’s Representative <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/legislators/assembly/1062" target="_blank">Dianne Hesselbein</a> and her office, <a href="http://www.ncghotels.com/team-members/jonathan-bogatay/" target="_blank">Jonathan Bogatay</a> (CEO of the North Central Group), Jennifer Hoff (News anchor and former reporter of WISC TV), family and friends, the Menominee Indian Tribe Legislation implemented common sense rafting safety regulations at the Wolf River. We hope that these measures will prevent further accidents in the future. You can read the law <a href="TribalGovernmentofMenomineeIndianTribeofWI_Chapter268.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <span class="number">2</span><h3>Lina Vergara Memorial Scholarship</h3><img class="butterfly" src="img/butterfly.png" alt="Butterfly" height="20" width="22" />
    </span>
    <p>My family created a scholarship endowment at UW-Oshkosh and an annual scholarship at Middleton High School in order to help Elementary Education Students who, like me, care for kids and dream of a better world. For detailed information about the endowment, <a href="lina_vergara_memorial_scholarship_information.pdf">view this pdf</a>.<p>If you would like to make a contribution, please make your check payable to: <b>Glowing Smiles Lina's Fund Inc.</b> and mail your gift to <b>7752 Solstice Ct, Verona  WI 53593</b>. Your donation will benefit next year's scholarship recipients and is tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.</p></div>

    <span class="number">3</span><h3>Participate in the 5k Run/Walk</h3><img class="butterfly" src="img/butterfly.png" alt="Butterfly" height="20" width="22" />
    </span>
    <p>Finally, my family wishes to promote an annual 5K race/walk in my hometown of Middleton, WI, which, besides being a funding source towards the scholarship, will be a tribute to my memory.
